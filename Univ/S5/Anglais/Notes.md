let's turn now to my soft skils


So, ok, i have 2 minutes to convince you to hire me for this job.
Let's start with me. My name is Elouan Reymond, i'm 20 and I come from Lyon. Yes you know this beautiful french city were you can find the university Claude Bernard. And yes, that's where I study. It's not the most prestigious of schools, but it ok. I'll be a graduate at the end of the year and i want to be accepted in a master of computer science.

Hi, I'm Elouan, I'm 20 and I'm in computer science in lyon. I'll be a graduate at the end of the year and i want to be accepted in a master of computer science. Let me introduce you my skills. /cut/

First of all my soft skills : I'm a very curious person and like to ask people questions about their work. I am motivated and autonomous for many tasks. About my interests, I'love sports like hiking, volleyball or swimming, I also like cooking.

(ne pas oublier de tilter Jérem)

About my hard skills, I learned a lot of things the tree past years. I'm specialized in web site development in frond end with many frameworks. I can cite svelte, react, vuejs or angular that I use in my company. For the back end, I also build API to interact with databases. To do this, I use different frameworks in different languages. My favorites are SpringBoot, Nestjs and ExpressJs. I don't really like python frameworks, unlike my cameraman Corentin. I'm polyvalent in the use of different databases, both SQL and NoSQL.

I'm currently working for a company called Axopen, which does IT support for other companies.
